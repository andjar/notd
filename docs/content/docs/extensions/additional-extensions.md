## Extension Integration Tips

### Cross-Extension Workflows

Combine extensions for powerful workflows:

```markdown
# Project Documentation Sprint {type::project}

## Planning (Kanban Board)
TODO Outline documentation structure {board::docs-sprint}
DOING Research existing content {board::docs-sprint}

## Writing (Zen Mode + Pomodoro)
TODO Write API docs {pomodoros::4} {zen-mode::enabled}

### Property-Based Extension Coordination

Use properties to coordinate between extensions:

```markdown
