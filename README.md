There are lots of notetaking systems out there, yet none of them fitted my workflow. For a long time, LogSeq was perfect, but the new db version introduces too much complexity and clutter. These are the features I need:

- Simple and future proof. Keep the text in a sqlite db and uploads in dated subfolders. Text formatted with markdown. That way, it is easy to change things later.
- No compiling. Notetaking is not *that* complex. I wanted to use php and primarily vanilla js. That way, I can just copy my files over and have a new instance. I can use phpDesktop or host it somewhere, or even keep it on a memory stick.
- Outlining with a journal. This the main interface in LogSeq and works wonderfully.
- Simple task management. I need to have TODOs and also to know when things were DONE.
- Linking, backlinking, transclusion. They make life easier.
- Properties. I don't use properties a lot, but it is useful (e.g., to note when the TODOs were done, or to add a deadline, or add tags)

This small project is also a test of so called "vibe coding" - using LLMs to quickly iterate. So far, it looks promising. But one of the biggest challenges in notetaking business remain to be tested: *will I stick to it long term?*
