## Plan Forward / Roadmap

**notd** is under active development.

## Getting Started / Installation

Setting it up is straightforward. You'll generally need a web server environment with PHP and SQLite support.

1.  **Server Environment:** Make sure your web server is ready to serve the application files and has PHP and SQLite capabilities.
2.  **Permissions:** Ensure the web server has write permissions for the `db/` directory (or the custom path you set in `config.php` for your database).
3.  **Configuration:** If `config.php` doesn't exist, copy `config.php.example` to `config.php`. You can then update `DB_PATH` in `config.php` if you wish to store the database in a custom location (default is `db/notd.sqlite`).
4.  **Launch:** Open **notd** in your web browser by navigating to its URL on your server. Enjoy!

The application is also designed with [phpdesktop](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop) in mind, allowing it to be packaged as a standalone desktop application. If using a phpdesktop build, refer to its specific instructions.
